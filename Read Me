Find the Greatest of the Two Numbers in Java
Given two integer input Number1 and Number2, the objective is to write a Java code to compare both the Numbers and Find the Greatest of the Two Numbers. To do so we’ll use if-else statements and print the output. Some methods to solve the above-mentioned Problem are given below.

Method 1: Using if-else Statements
Method 2: Using Ternary Operator
Method 3: Using inbuilt max Function
All the above-mentioned methods are discussed in detail in the sections below.
Method 1: Using if-else Statements
In this method we’ll use if-else statements to compare the two numbers and two numbers and print out the greatest.

Working
For the two given user inputs number1 and number2

Check if both the integers are equal, print “Equal” if true.
Check if number1>number2, print number1 if true.
Check if number2>number1, print number2 if true.
Let’s implement the working in Java Language.

Method 2: Using Ternary Operator
In this method we’ll use the Ternary Operator and compare the two numbers to check for the greatest among them.

Ternary Operator Syntax
( Condition ) ? ( if True : Action ) : ( if False : Action )
Working
For the given integer inputs number1 and number2

Initialize the required variable.
Check for the greatest among the two using Ternary Operator.
Let’s implement the working in Java Language.

Method 3: Using inbuilt max Function
In this method we’ll use the inbuilt max function to get the greatest of the two integer inputs.

Working
For the two integer inputs number1 and number2

Initialize the required variables.
Call the inbuilt max function with number1 and number2 as arguments.
Print the returned value.
Let’s implement the working in Java Language.
